# EDD Metrics

Add beautiful, advanced metrics to your Easy Digital Downloads for WordPress installation.

Metrics all include a comparison to the previous period, so you can see if they are going up or down.

### Metrics

- Revenue
- Sales
- Average revenue per customer
- Estimated yearly revenue
- Estimated monthly revenue
- Refunds
- Discounts
- Renewals, and renewal rate (if EDD Software Licensing is active)
- Subscriptions (if EDD Recurring Payments is active)
- Earnings by download
- Earnings by gateway
- New customers

Charts are displayed on the detail page along with other metrics.

This plugin is inspired by (and basically a total copy of) [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com/). I would have just used Baremetrics instead of building a new plugin, except that Baremetrics is very specific to SaaS businesses, and doesn't really work for EDD.

### Usage

Install and activate this plugin on your WordPress site, then visit the "Metrics" menu under the "Downloads" left menu item.
